Quick System Info PRO
=====================

Quick System Info is an utility application for quick access of the basic system information for your Android platform, including information for CPU, memory, SD Card, running processes, network states and installed applications.

**This project initially started back in April 2010 after I got my first Android smart phone - 'HTC Magic'. It's a such exciting experience at that time.**

**Now after 11 years, Android has evolved so much and became more than complicated this little app can handle. So it's time to say goodbye.**

This is the PRO version that previously supported by donations from all around the world.

See [who](http://qsysinfo.appspot.com/supporters.jsp) loves this app the most !

## Testimonials ##

> *"I was an "early adopter" to Android, aka a geek who's generally aware which of the hundreds of "thank god someone's finally thought to make...", a sys info util in this case, apps were the good, original in some cases, ones that've since been blatantly plagiarized.. this is a textbook app dating back to the stone age that's always found its' way onto my phones, remained updated and definitely warrants coughing up a pretty token fee for.. imho, anyway :)"* - ***Tom Fowler***


> *"Absolute superlative app... Works great on Marshmallow.. Can't believe the time and energy the developer put into this app... Please give the guy a üçª.. You don't stumble upon these amazingly system tweaking utilities often. Namaste Mr. or Mrs Developers and I personally appreciate your precious time spent for us 'Droiders! Salute!"* - ***John Compton***

> *"Positively one of the best Device Apps ever created. Perfectly examines the important details and actually does a better job at it than any other I have implemented. Also has the ability to display info in the notification shade. Thanks!!! SUPERB QUALITY. "* - ***MAM ONE***

> *"I'd like to acknowledge this Dev and the incredible app he has created. I have had this app on all of my Android devices since my first one 6 years ago. It has never FC'd on me, bugged out or stopped working, ever. If only bigger developers would have the same quality control. Truly astounding work."* - ***Google Play user***

> *"Great app. This is the only one app that I just don't want to kill at all and it runs non-stop on my phone. It gives you a great control over your device with great visual and user interaction, history and monitoring of the most things you can possibly think of ..."* - ***Google Play user***
